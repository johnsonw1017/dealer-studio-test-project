## Instructions
- We would like you to deploy the React page as a website. We would suggest using something quick like CodeSandbox, Vercel or Github pages. However, anyway you prefer to launch a website will be fine.

- Build the Project using React ( or Next JS )

- Use SCSS (preferably) or CSS for the styling

- Use of components, e.g, the card should be made with components such as Card, CardImage, CardHeader, CardBody, Button. Please do not use ANY component libraries or packages like MUI or ANT design. We want to see you are able to build these components yourself.

- It should be responsive, and look good on desktop and mobile, the cards should be in a single row on mobile.

- Card 3 needs to have 2 paragraphs of text in it so it's higher than the other cards

- We are looking for attention to detail, padding, border radius, box shadow, overlays, alignment as per the design.

- We want to see some sort of state management being used, we would suggest on the border. On load, the middle card should have a border, when you click a cards button, the border should switch to that card that was clicked, but always be on the middle card on load.

- Push code to your Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket account so we can view the code
